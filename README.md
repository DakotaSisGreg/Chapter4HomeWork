*** Exercise 1 ***
AdditionCalculatorEx1
Description: This program prompts the user to enter two integers, adds them together, and displays the sum. It handles 
invalid inputs by prompting the user for a new input until valid integers are entered.

*** Exercise 2 ***
ArrayException
Description: Demonstrates handling of array index out-of-bounds exceptions and input mismatch exceptions. It fills an array 
with random double values and allows the user to access an element by specifying an index, ensuring handling of invalid 
accesses and inputs.

*** Exercise 3 ***
Triangle
Description: A representation of a triangle defined by three sides. It includes a method to check if the provided sides can
form a valid triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem, throwing a custom exception if the check fails.

Custom Exception for Triangle
Description:A custom exception class thrown when the sides of a triangle do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem,
ensuring that only valid triangles are processed.
